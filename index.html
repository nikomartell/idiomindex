                            With the College of Engineering, I helped develop a Digital Engineering Factory (DEF), a hub for Engineering Students

                            could access the software and related manuals. This was done using a Bootstrap provided by the IT Department and coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                            For my college Capstone Project sponsored by Roche, my team of 7 students across several engineering sectors developed a system meant to dispense and drain fluids on medical slides for diagnostic purposes.
                            Utilizing Python, I developed a GUI that could communicate with a Raspberry Pi, which acted as the hub for the system and connected the weight scale and pumps to the user's computer.

                            With a hub-&-spoke approach, the DEF was a project to provide engineering students with a place to access engineering software provided by the University of Arizona.
                            I helped create use cases, user stories, and requirements for the software while the team worked in an Agile environment to research and develop the category of software.
                            Responsible for the landing page, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the site and link it to the software and their respective manuals.
                            It is utilized by more than 200 students currently to assist with their engineering projects.
